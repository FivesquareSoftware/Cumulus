/**
 * @mainpage
 * RCResource is the primary public interface for RESTKit, and each instance is meant to reflect an actual resource residing on the WWW, generally accessed via a REST web service. 
 *
 * Configuration
 *
 * Child resources can be constructed from parents, and will inherit all the configuration information of their ancestors. Their URLs are constructed as sub-URLs to their parents, and they retain their parents, to allow dynamic lookup of an ancestor's configuration information. With the exception of headers, configuration is an either/or prospectâ€”it comes from only one resource in the chain, whether that is the receiver or one of the ancestors. Headers, being a mutable dictionary are merged down the whole tree.
 *
 * Lifecycle
 *
 * A resource has a lifecycle that is defined by the blocks you can run at various points in the execution of a request for the resource. These points are:
 *  - preflight, which can abort a request
 *  - progress, which can be either up or down depending on the type of request
 *  - postprocess, which can perform transformations and other work based on the results of the request
 *  - completion, which runs when a request completes, regardless of success or failure
 *  The posprocess block is unique because it runs on the high-priority concurrent global queue, whereas all the other blocks run on the main queue to allow UI code to safely run.
 *
 * Authentication
 *
 * Each resource can have an instance of an authentication provider, which implements <RCAuthProvider> and can do any kind of authentication that is supported by the protocol. A BASIC auth provider is included with RESTClient, and if username and password are set on a resource, an instance of this provider will be created on demand.
 *
 * Encoding/Decoding
 *
 * Payloads and results are serialized/deserialized automatically using instances of <RCCoder>.
 *  @see RCRequest for more information
