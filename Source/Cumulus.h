/*
 * Enlightenment is like the moon reflected on the water. The moon does not get 
 * wet, nor is the water broken. Although its light is wide and great, the moon 
 * is reflected even in a puddle an inch wide. The whole moon and the entire sky 
 * are reflected in dewdrops on the grass, or even in one drop of water.
 *
 * Enlightenment does not divide you, just as the moon does not break the water. 
 * You cannot hinder enlightenment, just as a drop of water does not hinder the 
 * moon in the sky.
 * 
 * The depth of the drop is the height of the moon. Each reflection, however long 
 * or short its duration, manifests the vastness of the dewdrop, and realizes the 
 * limitlessness of the moonlight in the sky.

/** Cumulus.h is the main header for the Cumulus HTTP clientâ€”include it in your project to use Cumulus. The Cumulus class interface provides global configuration options, some static methods for making one-off or non-conforming requests, and fixture configuration and usage. In general, however, the main point of usage for the Cumulus HTTP client is CMResource, which allows for simple configuration and resusability of response processing across any number of requests.
 *
 *  ### Static Request Interface
 *
 *  Static request methods simply create anonymous resources under the hood, delegating the request to that resource. They are useful if you have a non-conforming service, or you want to use Cumulus a a general purpose HTTP client (for which it is well suited).
 *
 *  - In all cases URL may be an NSURL or an NSString representing an URL
 *  - In general, the equivalent methods in CMResource should be preferred if you plan on using these more than once.

/** Log a message to the console. 
 *
 * Whether or not this method actually logs a message is controlled by setting CumulusLoggingOn in the environment (Generally by setting it in the environment of the Run phase of your target's scheme). Setting it to YES|true|1 turns logging on, setting it to NO|false|0 to turns logging off (the default is off).
 * @warning If you are writing code for Cumulus or a Cumulus extension, you shouldn't be calling this method. Instead, call the CMLog() macro, which includes compile time checks to make sure logging doesn't make it into a release build of your application or framework.
