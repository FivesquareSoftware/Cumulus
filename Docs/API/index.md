## About

Cumulus is a simple, powerful and blazingðŸ”¥ fast Cocoa HTTP+REST client that makes creating Cloud-backed apps stupidly easy.

## Getting Started

Using Cumulus is as simple as defining a resource and making a request. 

	CMResource *posts = [site resource:@"posts"];
	[posts getWithCompletionBlock:^(CMResponse *response) {
		postsController.posts = response.result;
	}];

Often you'll configure a base resourceâ€”like _site_ aboveâ€”and use its configuration to define child resources.

	CMResource *site = [CMResource withURL:@"http://example.com"];
	site.timeout = 20;
	[site setValue:@"foo" forHeaderField:@"X-MyCustomHeader"];
	site.contentType = CMContentTypeJSON;
	site.username = @"foo";
	site.password = @"bar";
