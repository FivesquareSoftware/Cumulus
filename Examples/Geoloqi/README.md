## Demo Apps that use Cumulus

#### Geoloqi


Geoloqi is a simple app that uses the [Geoloqi API](https://developers.geoloqi.com/) to show some of the ways you can use [Cumulus][].

To try it out:

1. If you don't have one, go get a Geoloqi account at https://geoloqi.com
1. Clone the repo and submodules: `git --recursive clone git@github.com:FivesquareSoftware/Cumulus-Demo.git`
1. Open Examples.xcworkspace and buld/run 'Geoloqi' for whatever platform you want to target (iOS 5.0+ is required). 


#### Cumulus

[Cumulus](https://github.com/FivesquareSoftware/Cumulus) is a simple, powerful, blazing fast Cocoa HTTP client with lots of REST sugar to make creating Cloud-backed apps drop dead easy.
